                <p> Evolution Of <span> Java</span></p>
            </legend>
            <p id="special">Java was conceived by <span id="para">James Gosling, Patrick Naughton, Chris Warth, Ed Frank,
            and Mike Sheridan</span> at Sun Microsystems in 1991. This language was initially called
            “Oak” but was renamed “Java” in 1995. Somewhat surprisingly, the original impetus
            for Java was not the Internet! Instead, the primary motivation was the need for a
            platform-independent language that could be used to create software to be embedded
            in various consumer electronic devices, such as toasters, microwave ovens, and
            remote controls. As you can probably guess, many different types of CPUs are used
            as controllers. The trouble was that (at that time) most computer languages were
            designed to be compiled into machine code that was targeted for a specific type of
            CPU. For example, consider the C++ language.
            Although it was possible to compile a C++ program for just about any type of
            CPU, to do so required a full C++ compiler targeted for that CPU. The problem,
            however, is that compilers are expensive and time consuming to create. In an attempt
            to find a better solution, Gosling and the others worked on a portable, cross-platform
            language that could produce code that would run on a variety of CPUs under
            differing environments. This effort ultimately led to the creation of Java.
            About the time that the details of Java were being worked out, a second, and
            ultimately more important, factor emerged that would play a crucial role in the future
            of Java. This second force was, of course, the World Wide Web. Had the Web not
            taken shape at about the same time that Java was being implemented, 
            Java might have remained a useful but obscure language for programming consumer electronics.
            However, with the emergence of the Web, Java was propelled to the forefront of
            computer language design, because the Web, too, demanded portable programs.
            Most programmers learn early in their careers that portable programs are as
            elusive as they are desirable. While the quest for a way to create efficient, portable
            (platform-independent) programs is nearly as old as the discipline of programming
            itself, it had taken a back seat to other, more pressing problems. However, with the
            advent of the Internet and the Web, the old problem of portability returned with a
            vengeance. After all, the Internet consists of a diverse, distributed universe populated
            with many types of computers, operating systems, and CPUs.
            What was once an irritating but low-priority problem had become a high-profile
            necessity. By 1993 it became obvious to members of the Java design team that the
            problems of portability frequently encountered when creating code for embedded
            controllers are also found when attempting to create code for the Internet. This
            realization caused the focus of Java to switch from consumer electronics to Internet
            programming. So, while it was the desire for an architecture-neutral programming
            language that provided the initial spark, it was the Internet that ultimately led to
            Java’s large-scale success.</p>
